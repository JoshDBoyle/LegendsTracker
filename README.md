#Legends Tracker
##A robust deck and statistics tracker for The Elder Scrolls: Legends

###Roadmap
To begin with things will be slow as, while I'm a veteran Java and web dev, I am brand new to working directly with 
memory and OS processes.  This roadmap will be added to as I get further with the solution and based on community
feedback.

1. Deck tracking
2. Win/Loss tracking per deck along with information about the opponent's deck
